# Fabric CICD for Dataverse Lakehouses

This notebook will take Fabric items in one workspace and publish them to another workspace (e.g. Dev to Test). This notebook works for lakehouses created using Fabric link for Dataverse and associated tables, reports, notebooks, and symantic models. It will not work for other types of lakehouse tables at this time.
